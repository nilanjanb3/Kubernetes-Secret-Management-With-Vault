### Roadmap for Kubernetes Secret Management with HashiCorp Vault

#### **Stage 1: Foundation**
1. **Understand Kubernetes Secrets:**
   - Learn how Kubernetes manages secrets natively.
   - Practice creating, managing, and using Kubernetes secrets in workloads.
   - Explore risks and limitations of Kubernetes secrets.

   **Tasks:**
   - Create a Kubernetes secret (e.g., API keys or DB credentials).
   - Mount the secret into a Pod and use it in a containerized application.

2. **Introduction to HashiCorp Vault:**
   - Understand Vault's purpose and benefits for secret management.
   - Learn about Vault's core concepts: authentication, policies, dynamic secrets, and audit logging.

   **Tasks:**
   - Install Vault locally or use a managed instance.
   - Experiment with storing and retrieving a secret using Vault CLI.

#### **Stage 2: Integrating Vault with Kubernetes**
3. **Deploy Vault on Kubernetes:**
   - Use Helm to deploy Vault in your Kubernetes cluster.
   - Set up Vault as a StatefulSet with Persistent Storage.

   **Tasks:**
   - Deploy Vault using Helm with secure configurations.
   - Verify Vault pods and services are running.

4. **Vault Agent and Injector:**
   - Understand the Vault Agent Injector for Kubernetes.
   - Learn how to configure pods to automatically inject secrets from Vault.

   **Tasks:**
   - Configure the Vault Agent Injector for Kubernetes.
   - Create a demo app that uses secrets injected via the Vault Agent.

#### **Stage 3: Practical Scenarios**
5. **Dynamic Secrets Management:**
   - Explore dynamic secrets for databases (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL).
   - Learn how Vault dynamically generates credentials.

   **Tasks:**
   - Set up a database in your environment.
   - Configure Vault to generate dynamic database credentials.
   - Connect your application to the database using these credentials.

6. **Handling Expired Secrets:**
   - Learn about Vault's lease renewal and secret rotation.
   - Automate the process using Kubernetes CronJobs or external tools.

   **Tasks:**
   - Set a short TTL for a secret and observe its expiration behavior.
   - Implement auto-renewal for the secret in a Kubernetes app.

---

#### **Stage 4: Security Best Practices**
7. **RBAC and Policies:**
   - Set up Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Vault.
   - Map Kubernetes service accounts to Vault roles.

   **Tasks:**
   - Create Vault policies and attach them to specific Kubernetes service accounts.
   - Test access control for applications using different roles.

8. **Auditing and Monitoring:**
   - Enable Vault's audit logging.
   - Integrate Vault logs with a centralized logging solution like EFK.

   **Tasks:**
   - Configure and analyze Vault audit logs.
   - Create a dashboard to monitor secret access and usage patterns.

---

#### **Stage 5: Advanced Integrations and Real-World Scenarios**
9. **Multi-Cluster Secrets Management:**
   - Use Vault for secrets across multiple Kubernetes clusters.
   - Learn about namespaces, replication, and performance tuning.

   **Tasks:**
   - Set up a multi-cluster environment.
   - Configure Vault for cross-cluster secret access.

10. **Incident Simulation:**
    - Simulate scenarios like lost Vault access, secret rotation failure, or expired secrets in production.

    **Tasks:**
    - Implement disaster recovery for Vault.
    - Troubleshoot and resolve simulated incidents.

---

#### **Stage 6: Mini-Projects**
- **Project 1:** Build a secure application with Vault-integrated Kubernetes Secrets.
- **Project 2:** Implement dynamic secrets for a microservices architecture using Vault.
- **Project 3:** Design a secret rotation strategy for sensitive keys with Vault and Kubernetes.
